    "text": "School psychology is a broad field. Its researchers and practitioners have a wide range of training and expertise. This can make it hard to explain exactly who school psychologists are, but it’s also one of the field’s greatest strengths. And, we’re here to help.\nA quick google search will tell you a lot about who school psychologists are not. We’re not school counselors, social workers, or psychiatrists — although we may work with each of these professionals. Sometimes we’re both certified school psychologists and licensed psychologists. Some school psychologists hold specialist degrees (EdS) and some hold doctorates (PhD or PsyD).\nSchool psychologists are mental health professionals who are trained in education (particularly special education for students with disabilities) and psychology across the areas of prevention, assessment, intervention, and consultation with teachers and families. School psychologists help teachers and parents find solutions to academic, social, emotional, or behavioral challenges their children are experiencing.\nIn addition to working with individuals, school psychologists work to make sure the school as a whole is meeting the needs of all students. Importantly, the profession emphasizes evidence-based practices — meaning scientific research guides their decisions and actions.\nWith this broad training, individual school psychologists often develop deeper expertise in a particular area based on their interests and the needs of their school such as behavior supports, academic interventions, crisis, and/or mental health.\nYou can learn more about the field of school psychology on the website of the National Association of School Psychologists."

    "title": "Schools are not prepared for flooding caused by the climate crisis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This week, Hurricane Ida wrought havoc and flooding from New Orleans to New York City. Expert research has shown that the climate crisis is increasing the frequency and severity of climate disasters. It is no secret that huge amounts of infrastructure are increasingly vulnerable to these disasters. As communities make plans (or fail to make plans) to adapt to the damages already locked in by burning fossil fuels, schools cannot be left out of the discussion.\nA colleague and I recently published a brief analysis of publicly available climate modeling data to estimate how many schools in the US will flood under various climate change scenarios. We used the Surging Seas Risk Finder from Climate Central to aggregate data and suggest how educators, students, and community members might use this tool to advocate for their communities to prepare.\nOur calculations show that even under a “medium” climate change scenario, roughly 5 feet of sea level rise by 2100, 1677 schools in the coastal US would flood each year by 2100. Under the same scenario, 2262 coastal US schools would flood every 10 years by 2100.\nThese are admittedly crude calculations; we work in the field of school psychology and are not climate scientists. And our calculations are almost certainly underestimates. A “medium” climate change scenario is fast becoming overly optimistic. Upper ranges of climate change scenarios put sea level rise at over 10 feet by 2100. The calculations also assume no change in the severity or frequency of storms, which we are already witnessing. Our calculations only included coastal areas (minus Alaska and Washington DC, for which data were not available) — but we know inland states will experience flooding linked to the climate crisis as well.\nThe toll of such flooding is not distributed equally. Already disadvantaged communities will bear the brunt of the costs. These costs are monetary, but also include damages to physical and mental health (including loss of life), losses of instructional time and educational records, and loss of community connections and gathering places. Additionally, many communities use schools as shelters during times of crisis — an option that will not be available when they have flooded.\nGiven the damages to schooling the climate crisis presents — particularly the mental health of students, educators, and families — we argue that community planning for the climate crisis should include school psychologists at the table. As experts in both schooling and mental health, school psychologists (and other school-based mental health providers) are well positioned to make a difference both before, during, and after community climate crises.\nFurther information on how climate crisis induced flooding effects schools is available in our paper linked above, which is open access and available for free. More information about school psychologists is available from the National Association of School Psychologists. Lastly, check out the Surging Seas Risk Finder tool below by exploring the data for your area."

    "title": "Firearm lethal means counseling in schools",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Firearms are ubiquitous in the United States. However, few people here are aware that most gun deaths in the US are suicides. Young people are not exempt. Firearms account for roughly 46% of suicides in the United States for young people ages 0-24 – nearly 3,000 deaths per year – making guns the most frequently used means of suicide death for this age group in the country [1].\nDespite seemingly endless cycles of gun violence, including tragic school shooting after tragic school shooting, gun regulations remain lax in many states throughout the U.S. For example, in Texas – where I currently live – students over age 21 can legally carry firearms on college campus. Starting this fall, a permit or training is no longer a legal requirement to carry a firearm in Texas. Gun owners in Texas are can also legally store their firearms in their cars parked on the property of k-12 schools.\nIn the US more broadly, 4.6 million children live in a home with an unlocked firearm [2]. Of the 70% of parents of adolescent children who report that their child cannot access their firearm(s), 30% were contradicted by adolescent report [3]. One in five young people reported handling a firearm within the home without their parent’s knowledge [4]. Perhaps most startlingly, households with youth who have expressed suicidal ideation or attempted suicide are less likely to safely store their firearms that households with youth who have not expressed suicide risk [5][6].\nLethal means counseling is an approach that talks with individuals and families about limiting the accessibility of lethal means when a student or family member is suicidal – particularly securing and/or removing firearms. Means safety interventions – including means safety counseling regarding firearms – have considerable evidence in preventing suicide across a variety of populations and means, including for youth and firearms [7]. It is standard practice in the care of suicidal individuals and has been implemented in both mental health and medical settings such as emergency rooms and primary care practices.\nHowever, the practice is less common among school mental health staff. For example, data collected as part of my dissertation on the attitudes school principals hold toward suicide prevention, only 3% of the sample said their school offered information to parents on safer firearm storage despite implementing many other suicide prevention practices [8]. If this rate is reflective of the population at large, school staff are missing an important opportunity to intervene with suicidal youth and their families to help ensure safety. For those who would like to learn more about conducting lethal means counseling regarding firearms, a free online training is available here [9]. Additionally, for a book length treatment on the relationship between firearms and suicide in the United States, Michael Anestis has written an excellent book titled Guns and Suicide: An American Epidemic [10].\n\nReferences\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021.

    "title": "Hey Google: Do school psychologists…?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Inspired by this post by Sean Erreger LCSW, I thought I’d tackle answering some common questions about school psychology suggested by Google’s autocomplete function.\nFirst, a quick disclaimer. School psychology is a broad field and there are differences between various states and local school districts. This post will speak about the general context in the United States — but your mileage may vary. Secondly, school law (and particularly special education law) is quite complex and I am not a lawyer — this article is not legal advice nor definitive legal information.\nNow without further ado:\n\nDo school psychologists get summers off?\nMostly yes, with some important caveats. Most school psychologists employed in public schools follow the school calendar, meaning they are on roughly 10 month employment contracts. School psychologists that do not work in k12 schools are more likely to work year-round contracts. However, even those that work in public schools may have summer work. Some schools hire school psychologists to complete special education evaluations over the summer even though school is not in session. School psychologists also use the summer to complete professional development trainings and prepare for the coming school year. Some school psychologists also work summers providing extended school year services to special education students.\n\n\nDo school psychologists work in the summer?\nSee above.\n\n\nDo school psychologists need a PhD?\nMostly no. Most school psychologists in the United States posses a specialist degree (e.g., EdS), which is roughly a master’s degree plus 30 additional credits. This is the standard for practice in the k12 public school system. However, many school psychologists do have doctoral degrees (e.g., PhD or PsyD). School psychologists with a doctoral degree and that meet additional state requirements are eligible for a full psychology licensure that enables independent clinical practice outside of the school system.\n\n\nDo school psychologists get paid in the summer?\nSee above. There are opportunities for summer pay. Even if a school psychologist works a 10 month contract, they typically have the option of having their pay evenly distributed across 12 months so they do not have to budget for two months without income.\n\n\nDo school psychologists make good money?\nThis depends on what you consider good money. In general, people that work in the k12 public education system are underpaid compared to those with similar training that work outside of public education. The 2019–2020 median salary of school psychologists in the United States was $74,000. However, pay varies considerably by region. For example, the median pay in the western states was $80,000 while the median pay in the southern states was $63,000.\n\n\nDo school psychologists qualify for loan forgiveness?\nIn general, yes. More information on specific paths is available here.\n\n\nDo school psychologists diagnose?\nThis is a simple question with a somewhat complicated answer. Specialist-level school psychologists generally do not diagnose. However, they make recommendations to a child’s special education committee (called an IEP team) for a child to be “classified” or “found eligible” under various disability categories codified in special education law. School psychologists that are also fully licensed psychologists can diagnose. However, sometimes even these school psychologists might not provide a diagnosis when working within the school system.\n\n\nDo school psychologists need to be licensed?\nYes. Although, in many states use the language of “certification” for specialist-level school psychologists instead of licensure. This process is typically through the state education agency. In addition to being certified by the state education agency, doctoral-level school psychologists may also be licensed by the state board of psychology if they meet the requirements for independent practice. This process is typically through the state psychology board.\n\n\nDo school psychologists do therapy?\nIt depends. School psychologists have many roles within various school systems. Some exclusively provide assessment while some have job duties that also include counseling. In general, school-based counseling is not the same as private “therapy” in that the goal is to enable success in the school system rather than treat a diagnosed condition per se. Given high caseloads and limited resources in public schools, school psychologists typically do not provide the weekly hour long therapy sessions that the outside mental health sector might provide. Rather, they focus on brief skill-building counseling, crisis counseling, and consultation with teachers and parents to help improve the child’s functioning. School psychologists who are licensed at the doctoral level may provide more traditional therapy in out-of-school settings.\n\n\nDo school psychologists diagnose autism?\nAs discussed above, it depends. In general, most school psychologists do not provide medical “diagnoses” but do make recommendations that an IEP team consider a student eligible under the special education category of autism. In special education, eligibility is a team decision versus a diagnosis from one person. For autism assessments, there may be other assessment personnel involved besides school psychologists such as speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, and special education teachers. Doctoral school psychologists that are licensed for independent practice can diagnose autism, although they might not provide a diagnosis if they’re working in the school system depending on local norms and regulations."

    "title": "Highlighting measurement challenges in suicide research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Measuring complex constructs related to suicide (i.e., suicidal ideation, planning, behaviors, intent, attempts, etc.) is extremely challenging. Many of these terms lack agreed upon definitions and are frequently used imprecisely, making accurate measurement difficult in even the best designed studies [1]. Without accurate measurement, however, the validity of psychological research is severely limited. This post briefly overviews a handful of the many measurement challenges that are particularly relevant to suicide research.\n\nPrediction challenges\nResearchers are still largely unable to predict who will die by suicide from the general population with any meaningful accuracy. When studying how well a measure or set of measures can predict an outcome, a statistic called the positive predictive value or PPV is calculated. Roughly speaking, this would be the percent of suicides that were correctly predicted. The PPV depends on the base rate of the outcome the researcher is trying to predict. For simplicity, if the base rate of suicide is 10 per 100,000 people (the actual rate in the United States, for example, is closer to 14 per 100,000) and we had an idealized measure with 99% specificity (detects 99% of true negatives) and 99% sensitivity (detects 99% of true positives), we could still only predict suicide correctly 1% of the time [2]. Using a high-risk population, say 500 per 100,000, the PPV using the idealized measure is 0.33 – meaning the prediction would be correctly only 1 out of 3 times [2]. Improved measurement can improve predictions, but only up to a certain point.\n\n\nPsychometric challenges\nResearchers have a variety of methods to evaluate the psychometric qualities of their measures. Some, like citing the reliability of the measure from previous studies or informally examining the content validity of the items when selecting the measure, are common in applied research. Others, discussed below, are much less commonly evaluated in applied work but could be incorporated more widely into suicide research.\nOne such area is measurement invariance (i.e., whether the measure used performs the same across groups or time periods). Better establishing research findings across different groups (i.e., gender, race, socioeconomic status, professional groups, diagnoses, or across time) may lead to more effective and tailored interventions. However, to do this well, the measures used need to be tested to see if they perform the same across groups. If they do not, this may compromise the validity of the study yet on the other hand may lead to important questions investigating the reason for the differences. Confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory techniques can help investigate questions of invariance [3][4].\nAnother area is developing measures that help quantify how much more of a construct a person has versus other subjects. In other words, knowing one person is more suicidal than a different person is useful – but knowing how much more would likely be much more informative. Most measures used in psychology are ordinal measures – that is, they allow researchers to rank who has more or less of a construct but not how much more or less. On an ordinal scale, a score of 10 means there is more of what’s measured than a score of 5, but it does not tell us that a 10 is twice as much as a 5. To answer that question, different types measures need to be studied, developed, and used, but this type of measure development is rarely undertaken in suicide research. While ordinal scales are often treated as interval for analysis, this assumption can lead to inaccuracies. Rasch models provide one avenue for this work [5].\nWhen using single item measures of suicidality with ordinal response options (e.g., the suicide item on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), the assumption is that amount of what is measured corresponds to a subsequent increase at each successive response choice (i.e., monotonicity). This is an assumption, however, that needs to be tested. Recent work, for example, tested whether the following item assessing suicidal behaviors was monotonic: 1 = Never; 2 = It was just a brief passing thought; 3 = I have had a plan at least once to kill myself but did not try to do it; 4 = I have had a plan at least once to kill myself and really wanted to die; 5 = I have attempted to kill myself, but did not want to die; 6 = I have attempted to kill myself, and really hoped to die. The study found, however, that the item was only monotonic if responses 4 and 5 were swapped – suggesting a plan with high intent may be a higher threshold than a low-intent attempt [6]. Assessing multiple items along a continuum in this way may prove even more informative.\nMost frequently, measures in applied research are scored using most straight-forward option: sum scores. However, sum scores have significant draw backs as they assume the scale is unidimensional and that each item contributes equally to the construct. The dimensionality of scales and the relative contribution of each item is often assumed, yet rarely tested. The increased use of factor scoring methods may add important accuracy to measures [3]. It may also add greater conceptual validity in allowing certain items to ‘count’ more than others (e.g., having a suicidal ideation item contribute more to the total score than a different item on a depression scale).\n\n\nConstruct challenges\nThe various constructs that make up suicidal thoughts and behaviors are certainly not the only ones relevant to suicide research. Even psychological constructs that receive much more research attention are notoriously difficult to precisely define. When using DSM-5 criteria, for example, there are roughly 1,000 combinations of symptoms that can qualify someone as having Major Depressive Disorder [7]. Given that suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors are one of these symptoms, and how often the presence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is assessed in depression scales, further specifying within research studies well-known constructs like depression and being transparent about the choice to use one depression scale over another in suicide research may prove useful to the field. For example, Fried has shown that among seven commonly-used depression measures, the items measured 52 distinct symptoms and often had surprisingly little overlap in the symptoms measured [8]. There are also challenges regarding which quality of the construct is measured (i.e., presence/absence, frequency, duration, intensity). These qualities are often conflated within one item or one measure, adding to the precision problems of measurement in the field.\nThere are also many constructs related to suicide that have received far less measurement attention than depression. These constructs – such as hopelessness, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, acquired capability, attitudes toward suicide, attitudes toward firearms, belief in the preventability of suicide, psychological flexibility, self-concept, and many others – often do not receive the measurement attention that might further improve their utility to the field. They also sometimes show surprising, if not contradictory findings that might be further explored through measurement research. For example, one study found that 69% of surveyed emergency room nurses thought lethal means counseling was effective in preventing suicide and 91% felt that lethal means counseling was something that providers should do. However, most nurses (60%) in the study reported doubting that suicide was preventable [9]. Does this finding present a potentially important intervention point – or does this evidence measurement and construct issues? Without better measurement, interpreting the “why” of this study would be extremely difficult and the questions raised remain open.\nMeasurement techniques can also help us understand which symptoms and/or which related constructs might be most effective to target first. Techniques from network psychometrics can show which symptoms exert the most influence on the other symptoms [10]. In other words, it can help us develop interventions that start by targeting the one symptom that if improved would be most likely to result in improvements in other symptoms in the network. Importantly, network psychometrics can also examine “tipping points” in symptom networks that occur when certain symptom increases cause dramatic increases across the network. This could prove especially meaningful in suicide research in identifying acute risk [11].\nGiven the difficulty of measuring more abstract constructs like suicidal thoughts and behaviors or related constructs like depression, more concrete measures like self-reports of suicide attempts are sometimes used. However, this is also not without its own measurement challenges. Recent research has shown that about 35% of veterans answered inconsistently when given five different measures of prior suicide attempts [12]. Data from emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and death certificates are also useful sources of less abstract data – but only to the extent that we know how well attempts and suicides are classified in those sources.\n\n\nMeeting these challenges\nMeasurement is a critical component of research, yet its nuances and technicalities are often overlooked. Flake and Fried call this the “measurement schmeasurement” attitude in research [13]. Techniques like confirmatory factor analysis, network psychometrics, item response theory, and Rasch models can overcome some of these limitations and could be further incorporated into applied suicide research. Thankfully, these techniques are more readily available than ever before given their implementation in the free and open-source R statistical software packages, the increase in large datasets, and extensive online tutorials in their use.\nFor those that would like to read more about measurement and psychometric issues, Fried and Flake have put together a helpful Google Doc of essential readings that can be found here: Measurement Matters Resource List.\n\n\nReferences\n1.

    "text": "January 25, 2024. University of Houston Clear Lake\nI went to a small high school of 400 students—that is 400 total, not 400 per grade (real small compared to the schools here in Houston—in an isolated town of about 10,000 people. When I was a senior, there were a cluster of youth suicides at our school. Each student had their unique struggles, each from different cliques. Our community was shocked and devastated. Each of us was asking: What is the solution to a community in so much pain? The answer, I believe, is community itself. Community, reaching out to each other, showing each other that we are not alone, that we are not a burden, can be tremendously powerful. This bench is a physical reminder that we are in community and that help is available.\n\nHow to help, of course, is not always clear and there is never one solution to a wicked problem like suicide. But there are several things the data has shown us over the years. The first is that genuine connection, a helping hand, a voice on the crisis line, matters. This bench is a beautiful reminder of this. Second is that treatments for suicide are not all created equal, some are, in fact, far more likely than others to be helpful. The three treatments with the best evidence are dialectical behavior therapy, brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for suicide prevention, and CAMS, the collaborative assessment and management for suicidality. Communities, together, can demand more access to these treatments. Lastly, we can help make the environment safer for people in crisis. In the US, where most suicides are gun deaths and most gun deaths are suicides, this means helping people and their families decrease access to their firearms while they are in crisis (much like we work to remove access to someone’s car keys when they are drunk).\nIf you’ll allow it, I’d to close with another brief story—that of Marsha Linehan. Linehan was a psychologist and quite successful academic. She developed Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT for short), what was, and still is, one of the only treatments with actual scientific evidence of helping suicidal people. Near the height of her career, she gave a major address at the Institute of Living – a prominent psychiatric institute in Connecticut. Instead of laying out her many achievements or discussing the latest scientific data, she shared that this was not her first time at the Institute for Living. That as a teen, she had been institutionalized at the Institute for nearly two years and was described by the physicians as one of the most severe patients there. This was part of how she knew what was going to be needed to successfully treat highly suicidal people—because she had been there herself. She made a vow that she would get herself out of the hell of pain she was in and find a way to get others out of hell too. She did that with DBT.\nBut Marsha is adamant that DBT is not a suicide prevention program. The goal is not merely keeping people from killing themselves. The goal is to help others build lives they experience as worth living. And that is all our task as well. To help others build lives they experience as worth living. To find relief from the pain, yes, but to also move toward what they see as a valued life. May this bench be a reminder that connection helps build lives worth living.\nThank you."

    "title": "Advice for new grad students",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During undergrad, I was friends with two grad students getting their PhDs in a top English program. During my junior and senior year, I started going to panels and talks about going to grad school. The one constant about these panels was that one of the grad students on the panel cried. Every time. This isn’t a pretty profession — but the same can be said of nearly every job under our current capitalist system.\nIt’s also an experience that can be exciting and fulfilling. (Tip 1: Embrace “both/and.”) After all, when in service of your values action that involves pain is vastly more tolerable — and can even be liberating.\nNow that I’m on the “other side” of grad school (which makes me sound like a chicken that crossed the road — I’m sure there’s a metaphor for academia there somewhere…), I thought I’d share some things that helped me along the way. This post is targeted at doc students in health service psychology, public health, or similar fields that balance research and practice.\nWithout further ado:\n\nBeing both a clinician and a researcher is a monumental challenge but also a powerful gift. Academia has been called a rat race, a Ponzi scheme, self-indulgent, and an overall bad life choice. Being both a clinician and a researcher gives you an immediate connection to important whys, a leg up in communicating research (even if it’s just to your patients or trainees), and — not insignificantly — gives you an accessible and meaningful out if and when the time comes.\nPay attention to meta science from the very beginning. We are in a research crisis of our own making. Understanding the practices and forces that lead us here and what can be done to improve science are not really optional for the scientific enterprise as a whole and shouldn’t be optional for you as an individual. This involves building up a level of applied statistical knowledge, which is admittedly challenging — but it’s easier to be motivated to understand statistics when the background noise is, “Shit. This is wrong, has been wrong for a long time, and has had negative consequences.” As a clinician and researcher, it’s perhaps easier to know deeply the consequences of our errors.\nGet organized yesterday. Luckily, we are a generation of researchers training with huge technological advantages. PDFs and citations are a breeze with Zotero. Accessing Google Scholar on a university network gives us access to nearly unlimited information. Cloud file storage (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc) means never losing your work and having automatic file versioning. Twitter puts entire networks of scientists in nearly every discipline in your pocket. Every common applied statistical problem is google-able and stats experts have usually already posted the R script somewhere online. Notes programs like Evernote make everything organized and searchable — even photos of handwritten notes. If I do not write it down, I will forget it. Carrying a small notebook (shout out to Ryder Carroll and the Bullet Journal method) or quickly capturing something on my phone when I for some reason don’t have my notebook has saved me multiple times.\nAcademic unions are the best strategy currently on the table for making grad school materially survivable. But they also make the success of the larger research endeavor and ethical operation of universities more probable. The university works because you do. I benefited greatly from being part of a very strong graduate union.\nSelf care does not mean bringing yourself to the edge of self destruction and then watching Netflix. Sleep is the most important thing in your schedule. Humans cannot be okay without it.\nA central dilemma to get comfortable with in grad school is opportunity on the one hand while overwhelm is on the other. If you’re reasonably lucky, you will get opportunities in grad school that might not ever surface again. When possible, push yourself to take them because they can be worth it. However, realize you will likely have to say no at some point to a good opportunity. Stay yourself now for that decision, because it can hurt to say no.\nRelatedly, observe your limits. In DBT, the language of setting limits is replaced with observing limits. It’s important to observe your limits — and sometimes know that limits are stretched and that’s okay.\nThere’s a saying in the ACT therapy tradition that says, “Hold it lightly.” Academia is an environment that encourages over-identification and idealization. If you start feeling like you’re part of the Jedi Order — start finding ways to hold that script a little more lightly. This is (or at least can be) important work, but so are many of other things. Academia is a job. There are many jobs where you can be similarly in service of your values.\nAnd speaking of therapy — it’s a good idea to consider the undertaking, especially if your university provides health insurance that allows you to afford it.\nAcademia is heavily political. Play the long game, and (not but) live your values. Political check-mates are deeply painful and usually supremely unjust. Even when things look like chance, remember that the house stacks its deck. A former advisor once told me that academia is not a home. I believe her.\nYour course work — despite there being a lot of it — is not enough. Always have your own reading list of things you feel you need: Either because they’re passions or because they’re filling in gaps. Consistently doing small amounts of reading in a particular area will be a huge advantage years down the line when it comes to writing a dissertation.\nBe clear about your narrative. What are you doing and why? How do things link together for you? Having a website with an “about me” page and a frequently updated CV has forced me to attend to this — and it has helped me personally clarify things many times. Relatedly, being a clone of your advisor isn’t the goal of grad school. Finding your niche can be a long, continually-evolving process. That’s okay.\nThe expectations of the ideal professor (or ideal graduate student) are both completely unrealistic and actually demanded by the system. Eiko Fried posted a list of expectations placed on him for his career stage. I wrote a similar list out for myself and it helped me see the absurdity and give myself some grace. Give yourself a break by reminding yourself that no one can be everything, no matter what or who is doing the demanding.\nEvery piece of advice and the presence of everyone above you in the academic hierarchy is subject to survivorship bias — including this post. Understanding survivorship bias in both your research and in the people around you can help you sense the bigger picture.\nScience and faith are not opposites. This has been the most important area of growth for me personally. Whether it be in capital F Faith of in the teachings of religions, faith that a better world is possible, faith that you have inherent dignity, faith that treating people well matters, faith that gives you a deeper connection with your self, faith that gives you a sense of connectedness with all living beings, faith that helps transcend the day to day, faith that keeps hope alive, etc. — remember none of this is the opposite of science."

    "title": "The country’s largest suicide prevention organization is in crisis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, members are resigning en mass from the American Association of Suicidology to protest the mishandling of the organization by a handful of board members.\nThe group was founded by clinical psychologist Edward Shneidman — a trailblazer in the field of suicide prevention — in 1968. For over 50 years, the organization has helped lead suicide prevention efforts in the states and fostered connections among stakeholders to ease suffering and build lives worth living.\nBut now, 53 years after its founding, it is in crisis due to the actions of a small number of board members. Internal political drama of organizations like this rarely make the news. But suicide prevention is a life passion of many — and a critical need for both the country and global community. Organizations like AAS provide inspiration and solace in work that brings people face to face with pain.\nAlthough the organization has not been forthcoming in sharing details of the crisis, many of its members have learned of recent issues through people speaking out on social media and posting public letters. Two weeks ago, eight of the organization’s past presidents — all of whom are eminent figures in the field — judged the situation to be so dire that they published a joint letter asking board chair Tony Wood to resign in hopes of salvaging the situation.\nThe letter stated that these leaders would resign their memberships from the organization should Tony Wood not step down and encouraged other members to consider doing the same. On August 30th, the elected president of the organization, Jonathan Singer — a respected social worker and youth suicide prevention expert — also publicly announced his resignation citing failures of Tony Wood’s leadership.\nToday is the last day of August. Like dozens of others, today I am cancelling my membership in protest as I no longer can support the organization under the current leadership.\nWhere this leaves the organization is unclear. Nearly all elected leadership positions are vacant due to principled resignations. The organization today announced an executive transition team — but it is unclear exactly what an organization in suicide prevention transitions to after many of the most prominent leading experts in the field no longer endorse it. Where professionals, loss survivors, and those with lived experience (groups that overlap more than we acknowledge) find their next home in is unclear for now.\nThanks to social media, many in the field have found connections to each other outside of the organization’s email listserv. Leaders in the field are discussing hosting a separate conference to continue the important mission of suicide prevention. Other organizations, particularly internationally, remain strong. Although the future of AAS is unclear, the work of suicide prevention and building lives worth living continues."
